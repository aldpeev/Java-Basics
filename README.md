# Java-Basics
- Here are all the labs and exercises I've completed as part of the Programming Basics course provided by SoftUni.

- The "Programming Basics" course provides foundational programming skills necessary for all technology-related fields at the Software University. This includes writing basic-level code, working with an integrated development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input data and printing results), and utilizing conditional statements (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).
